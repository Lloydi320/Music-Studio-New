If no .env file exists, create one with:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=music_studio
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret  
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback
```
