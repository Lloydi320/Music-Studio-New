# üö® URGENT: Upload Training Data to Elfsight Dashboard

## Problem Identified:
Your chatbot is giving generic responses like "I couldn't find specific information about rates or pricing" instead of your custom answers because **the training data from your JSON file hasn't been uploaded to the Elfsight dashboard yet**.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

### Step 1: Access Your Elfsight Dashboard
1. Go to [Elfsight.com](https://elfsight.com)
2. Log into your account

### Step 2: Upload Training Data

**COPY THIS EXACT TRAINING DATA TO YOUR ELFSIGHT DASHBOARD:**

#### Training Instructions:
```
Always match user questions to the most relevant FAQ. If user mentions rates, price, cost, fee, money, expensive, cheap, or affordable - use rates FAQ. If user mentions services, offer, provide, available, what do you do - use services FAQ. If user mentions equipment, gear, instruments, tools, microphone, speakers - use equipment FAQ. If user mentions book, booking, schedule, appointment, reserve, contact - use booking FAQ. If user mentions reschedule, change, cancel, modify, move - use rescheduling FAQ.
