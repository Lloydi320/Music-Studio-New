Your Music Studio application has been successfully deployed! The database is working with 18 tables created, all files are uploaded, but we need to fix the PHP-FPM configuration.

### ✅ **What's Working:**

## 🔧 **FINAL FIX - Run These Commands:**

```

### Step 3: Enable and start PHP-FPM service
```bash
systemctl enable php8.3-fpm
systemctl start php8.3-fpm
systemctl status php8.3-fpm
```

### Step 4: Update Nginx configuration
```bash
sed -i 's/php8\.2-fpm/php8.3-fpm/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/music-studio
```

### Step 5: Restart Nginx

## 🚨 **If You Need Help:**
If the commands above don't work, here's an alternative approach:

1. **Check PHP version available:**
   ```bash
   apt search php-fpm
   ```

2. **Install whatever PHP-FPM version is available:**
   ```bash
   apt install -y php-fpm php-mysql
   ```

3. **Find the correct service name:**
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service | grep php
   ```

4. **Update Nginx config with the correct PHP version:**
   ```bash
   nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/music-studio
   # Change the fastcgi_pass line to match your PHP version
   ```
