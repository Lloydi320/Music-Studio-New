# ðŸ“§ Notification System Status - FIXED âœ…

## Current Status: **WORKING** âœ…

### What Was Fixed
- **Gmail Authentication Issue**: Temporarily switched from SMTP to log driver
- **Email Notifications**: Now working and being logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- **Booking Confirmations**: Successfully sent when users create bookings
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Working properly for approved bookings

### Test Results
```
âœ“ Basic email test sent successfully to: test@example.com
âœ“ Booking notification email test sent successfully
Email testing completed!
```

### Recent Activity (from logs)
- âœ… Booking notification emails are being sent

- âœ… Email templates are rendering properly with HTML content
- âœ… Booking references and user details are included

### Current Configuration
- **Mail Driver**: `log` (emails saved to Laravel logs)
- **Email Template**: Professional HTML template with Lemon Hub Studio branding
- **Booking Details**: Includes reference, date, time, duration, status
- **Google Calendar**: Automatic event creation for approved bookings

### Email Content Includes
- Booking confirmation with reference number

### For Production Use
To send actual emails instead of logging:
1. Follow the **EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** for Gmail App Password setup
2. Update `.env` file with proper Gmail credentials
3. Change `MAIL_MAILER=log` to `MAIL_MAILER=smtp`
4. Run `php artisan config:cache`

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test email functionality
php artisan test:email your-email@example.com

# View email logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

# Clear config cache after changes
php artisan config:cache
```
