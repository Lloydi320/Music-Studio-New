# Booking Approval System

This document describes the newly implemented booking approval system that requires admin approval for all new bookings.

## Overview

The booking approval system ensures that all booking requests are reviewed and approved by an admin before being confirmed and added to Google Calendar. This provides better control over studio scheduling and prevents unauthorized bookings.

## Key Features

### 1. Pending Status for New Bookings
- All new bookings are created with `pending` status instead of `confirmed`
- Users receive a message indicating their booking is pending admin approval
- Pending bookings do not block time slots for other users
- Google Calendar events are not created until approval

### 2. Admin Approval Interface
- Admin dashboard displays all bookings with their current status
- Pending bookings show **Approve** and **Reject** buttons
- Confirmed/cancelled bookings only show the **Delete** button
- Color-coded status badges for easy identification

### 3. Approval Actions
- **Approve**: Changes status from `pending` to `confirmed` and creates Google Calendar event
- **Reject**: Changes status from `pending` to `cancelled`
- **Delete**: Removes booking entirely and deletes Google Calendar event (if exists)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### BookingController.php
- Modified `store()` method to create bookings with `pending` status
- Updated success message to indicate pending approval
- Removed immediate Google Calendar event creation
- Updated overlap checking to only consider `confirmed` bookings
- Updated API endpoint to only return `confirmed` bookings for calendar display

#### AdminController.php
Added new methods:
- `approveBooking($id)`: Approves pending booking and creates Google Calendar event
- `rejectBooking($id)`: Rejects pending booking (sets status to cancelled)

#### Routes (web.php)
Added new admin routes:
```php
Route::patch('/bookings/{id}/approve', [AdminController::class, 'approveBooking'])->name('admin.booking.approve');
Route::patch('/bookings/{id}/reject', [AdminController::class, 'rejectBooking'])->name('admin.booking.reject');
```

### Frontend Changes

#### Admin Dashboard (dashboard.blade.php)
- Added conditional action buttons based on booking status
- Pending bookings show: **Approve**, **Reject**, and **Delete** buttons
- Confirmed/cancelled bookings show: **Delete** button only
- Added CSS styling for success (approve) and warning (reject) buttons

## User Experience

### For Regular Users
1. User submits a booking request
2. System shows: "Your booking has been submitted and is pending admin approval. Reference: [REF]"
3. User waits for admin approval
4. Once approved, booking appears in Google Calendar

### For Admin Users
1. Admin sees pending bookings in the dashboard with yellow "Pending" status badge
2. Admin can:
   - **Approve**: Booking becomes confirmed and syncs to Google Calendar
   - **Reject**: Booking is cancelled
   - **Delete**: Booking is removed entirely
3. Admin receives success/error messages for each action

## Security Features

- All approval actions require admin authentication
- Only users with admin role can approve/reject bookings
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Google Calendar Integration

- Calendar events are created **only** after admin approval
- Pending bookings do not appear in Google Calendar
- Approved bookings automatically sync to calendar
- Rejected bookings never create calendar events
- Deleted bookings remove existing calendar events

## Time Slot Management

- Pending bookings do not block time slots for other users
- Only confirmed bookings prevent overlapping bookings
- Multiple users can request the same time slot (all pending until admin decides)
- Admin can approve the preferred booking and reject others

## Status Flow

```
New Booking ‚Üí pending ‚Üí confirmed (approved) ‚Üí [can be deleted]
                    ‚Üì
                cancelled (rejected) ‚Üí [can be deleted]
```

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Creating pending bookings
- Approving bookings (status change + Google Calendar sync)
- Rejecting bookings (status change to cancelled)
- Time slot availability (pending bookings don't block slots)
- Admin dashboard UI with different button states

## Files Modified

   - Updated API endpoint for calendar display
