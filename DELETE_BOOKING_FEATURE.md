## How to Use

### For Admin Users:
1. Login with an admin account
2. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Scroll to "Recent Bookings" section
4. Find the booking you want to delete
5. Click the "🗑️ Delete" button in the Actions column
6. Confirm deletion in the popup dialog
7. The booking will be removed from both database and Google Calendar

### Success Message Example:
```
Booking BKYDPR17Z9 for John Doe has been deleted successfully.
```

### Error Handling:
- If Google Calendar deletion fails, the booking is still deleted from database
- All errors are logged for debugging
- User receives appropriate error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Delete Flow:
1. **Authorization Check**: Verify user is admin
2. **Find Booking**: Locate booking by ID
3. **Google Calendar**: Delete event if `google_event_id` exists
4. **Database**: Remove booking record
5. **Logging**: Record all operations
6. **Response**: Redirect with success/error message

### Code Example:
```php
public function deleteBooking($id)
{
    // Admin check
    if (!Auth::check() || !Auth::user()->isAdmin()) {
        abort(403, 'Access denied. Admin access required.');
    }

    $booking = Booking::findOrFail($id);
    
    // Delete from Google Calendar
    if ($booking->google_event_id && $this->calendarService) {
        $this->calendarService->deleteBookingEvent($booking);
    }
    
    // Delete from database
    $booking->delete();
    
    return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'Booking deleted successfully.');
}
```
